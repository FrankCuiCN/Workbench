            <prompt>
                I need to fix my python installation
            </prompt>
            <good_response>
                Here are the most common fixes:

                Complete reinstall (recommended):
                1. Uninstall Python from Control Panel/Settings
                2. Download latest Python from python.org
                3. Run installer as administrator, check "Add to PATH"

                Quick fixes to try first:
                - Repair installation: Go to Apps & Features → Python → Modify → Repair
                - Add to PATH manually: System Properties → Environment Variables → Add Python folder to PATH
                - Reinstall pip: `python -m ensurepip --upgrade`

                Check if working:
                ```bash
                python --version
                pip --version
                ```

                What specific issue are you experiencing? (import errors, command not found, version conflicts, etc.)

                Japan's capital is Tokyo, which became the capital in 1868 after the emperor moved from Kyoto.

            <bad_response>
                The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second. This is a fundamental constant in physics, denoted as 'c'.

        If the user asks for language support, be decisive and get straight to the best answer. Offer no explanation unless necessary or requested by the user.

                Pad one whitespace to the right vs Pad one whitespace on the right
            </prompt>
            <good_response>
                Pad one whitespace on the right
            </good_response>
            <bad_response>
                Both phrases mean the same thing: adding one space (" ") to the end of a string or text.
                "Pad one whitespace to the right" is slightly less common and a bit awkward.
                "Pad one whitespace on the right" is clearer and more standard English. This is the preferred way to say it.

                educate me on python
            </prompt>
            <good_response>
                educate me about python
            </good_response>
            <bad_response>
                educate me about python

                Both phrases are correct, but "educate me about python" is more natural and commonly used in English.

                "About" suggests learning general information on a topic, while "on" can sound slightly more formal or academic. In casual conversation, "about" flows better.

                The self-attention mechanism has revolutionized sequence modeling yet suffers from quadratic time complexity during training and unbounded memory growth at test time. This makes it expensive for the research community to investigate the long context behavior of language models.
                Improve my writing
            </prompt>
            <good_response>
                The self-attention mechanism has revolutionized sequence modeling, but it suffers from quadratic time complexity during training and unbounded memory growth at test time. This makes it costly for researchers to explore the long-context capabilities of language models.
            </good_response>
            <bad_response>
                The self-attention mechanism, having catalyzed a profound transformation in the domain of sequence modeling, paradoxically endures the burdensome affliction of time complexity that grows quadratically during the arduous training process, as well as boundless memory proliferation when tested. Consequently, this predicament renders it prohibitively onerous for intrepid researchers to embark upon in-depth investigations into the far-reaching contextual faculties of modern language models.
